AniMatrix — AI-Powered Manim Animation System
AniMatrix is a premium, web-based tool and pipeline automation utility that uses the Gemini API to generate, compile, and refine Python code using the Manim Community Edition library. It features a complete web UI for editing and previewing animation code, auto-correcting errors with Gemini, and stitching multiple scenes into a unified video.

What It Has
FastAPI Backend (main.py):

/api/generate: Generates Manim code for a given text prompt using the Gemini API.
/api/render: Submits code to a sub-process compilation engine utilizing Manim.
/api/fix: Accepts error logs and code, asking Gemini to self-heal/repair syntax and Manim errors.
/api/stitch: Concatenates multiple rendering video segments together using MoviePy.
/api/history: Provides access to a JSON-based history file recording previous renders, prompts, code, and paths.
Web Frontend (static/):

Monaco Editor Integrations: Write, modify, and render custom Manim Python scripts directly in a browser-based IDE.
Live Preview Panel: Instantly play rendered MP4 files.
Gemini Auto-Fix Panel: If rendering fails, a single click will send compiler errors to Gemini to automatically heal your code and re-render.
Timeline Stitching Queue: Queue up scenes by checking them off and stich them into a single movie using MoviePy.
Download Center: Instantly download Python files or the rendered MP4 animations.
Standalone Automation Pipeline (pipeline_automation.py):

An interactive command-line interface (CLI) script that accepts prompts, writes code, tries to compile, and loops up to 3 times to automatically auto-correct compile issues using Gemini.
Prerequisites
To run Manim and MoviePy animations, your machine requires:

Python 3.12+
FFmpeg: Manim and MoviePy depend on FFmpeg for video rendering.
Windows: Install via winget install Gyan.FFmpeg or download from ffmpeg.org.
macOS: Install via brew install ffmpeg.
Linux: Install via sudo apt install ffmpeg.
Pango/Cairo (Required by Manim):
Normally handled by package managers or the python packages built during setup.
Setup & Configuration
Clone the Repository and navigate to the project directory.

Set up Environment Variables: Create a .env file at the root of the project:

GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
Sync Dependencies: This project uses uv to manage the virtual environment. Install uv if not already present, then sync dependencies:

uv sync
How to Run
1. Launch the Backend Server & Web UI
Start the FastAPI server:

uv run python main.py
The server will start on http://127.0.0.1:8000.
Open this URL in your web browser to access the Monaco editor workspace, prompt generator, live video preview, and timeline stitching interface.
2. Run the Interactive Command Line Pipeline
Alternatively, if you want to use the CLI automation script to generate animations:

uv run python pipeline_automation.py
Follow the prompt prompts to input animation ideas.
The script will interactively generate Python files, attempt rendering, and invoke Gemini auto-fixes upon failure.
